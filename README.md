In this paper, I study the impact of two distinct interventions that might help increase access to bike share programs â€“ membership subsidies and bike lane expansions. Empirical evaluations of such policy approaches can help city officials understand the extent to which they are actually achieving their overarching goals and encourage them to take additional actions if necessary. For my analysis, I examine the impact of an affordable membership program and the NYC Streets Plan on the CitiBike bike-share program in New York City. Ultimately, I find that there is not a statistically significant relationship between the percentage of people eligible for the subsidy program and the number of bike trips in each community district, suggesting that this intervention might not be sufficient to achieve the goal of increasing ridership among under-served populations. I also do not find indications that the construction of bike lanes has driven higher bike-share usage in their proximity. Both results are robust to various specifications of the treatment variables.

All code used for the project is available in this reporitory along with my final paper. For information about the datasets used in the analysis and where they can be accessed, please see the paper. 

Thank you to the course staff of SML312 for giving me the opportunity to undertake this independent project, and I hope you enjoy!
